# PocketBase Example ðŸ§ª

You need the PocketBase file to work. You can download it from the [documentation](https://pocketbase.io/docs/).

First, run the database:

`$ pnpm run db`

It should start the local server on port 8090. Then run the app itself by running:

`$ pnpm run dev`

This is an extremely basic example of how PocketBase can be used, by storing users and fetching them. Check the full documentation by clicking [here](https://pocketbase.io/docs/).
